## 🛡️ Project Overview

Modern aviation relies heavily on digital communication (ADS-B, ARINC 429, ACARS), which were often designed before the era of advanced cyber warfare. This repository enables:

1.  **Detection of Ghost Aircraft**: Using ML to flag spoofed ADS-B signals.
2.  **Avionics Bus Protection**: Identifying malicious command injections in flight control systems.

### 🌍 Real-World Context
With initiatives like the **FAB's Aerospace Cyber Defense Center (CDCAER)** and **Embraer's** growing focus on cyber-resilience, the need for AI-driven security in aviation is critical in 2026.

## 🚀 Key Modules (TRL-5 Architecture)

### 1. ADS-B Spoofing & MLAT-Correlation (`src/adsb_spoofing.py`)
**Framework**: **DO-260B (1090 MHz Extended Squitter)**
**Threat**: Adversaries broadcasting fake aircraft signals ("Ghost Aircraft") to trigger false TCAS Resolution Advisories.
**Solution**: An **Object-Oriented Isolation Forest** model bounded to a 70% CPU limit, tracking kinematic envelopes and preparing for Multilateration (MLAT) Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) correlation.
**Outcome**: Neutralizes "Impossible Physics" tracks, validating physical layer integrity (e.g., RSSI consistency).

### 2. Avionics Bar ARINC 429 Bus Defense (`src/avionics_anomaly.py`)
**Framework**: **DO-356A (LRU Insularity)**
**Threat**: A compromised Line Replaceable Unit (LRU) injecting validly structured but catastrophic commands (Logic Bombs).
**Solution**: An **Object-Oriented One-Class SVM** parsing 32-bit BNR ARINC 429 labels within continuous flight regimes.
**Outcome**: Flag alerts and neutralizes contextually catastrophic anomalies, such as deploying the landing gear (`VLO` Limit Exceeded) while cruising at Mach 0.78 / >270 KTAS.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

**2. Watch the Live Dashboard:**
```bash
docker logs -f ita_project_we_can_fly
```
*(Press `Ctrl + C` to exit the view)*

**3. Stop the Simulation:**
```bash
docker compose down
```

### Option B: Standard Docker
```bash
# 1. Build the image
docker build -t ita-project-we-can-fly .

# 2. Run the simulations
docker run ita-project-we-can-fly
```
