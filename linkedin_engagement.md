**Text:**
Congratulations to the T30 Class! Welcome to excellence. 🇧🇷✈️

Inspired by the innovation of **ITA (Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica)** and the growth of the Brazilian aerospace sector (**FAB**/**Embraer**), I decided to create a tribute project.

I just launched **"ITA Project: We Can Fly"** 🦅
A practical study on **Aviation Cybersecurity & AI**. The project simulates defenses against modern threats, such as *Ghost Aircraft* (ADS-B Spoofing) and malicious flight system injections, using **Python** and **Machine Learning**.

Technology moves the world, and security keeps it flying.
