🚀 **Securing the Skies with Artificial Intelligence** ✈️🛡️

Data science isn't just for ads or finance—it's the new frontier in Aviation Security.

With the rapid modernization of the **Força Aérea Brasileira (FAB)** and giants like **Embraer**, the aviation sector is becoming increasingly data-driven. But more connectivity means more exposure to cyber threats like **ADS-B Spoofing** (ghost aircraft) and **Avionics Bus Injections**.

To explore this, I built **"ITA Project: We Can Fly"** 🦅
A Python + ML study repository simulating how AI can defend aircraft systems.

**What's inside?**
✅ **ADS-B Spoofing Detector**: An Isolation Forest model that flags "impossible physics" in aircraft signals.
✅ **Avionics Anomaly Hunter**: A One-Class SVM analyzing ARINC 429 bus traffic to detect malicious command injections (e.g., "Gear Down" at Mach 0.7).
✅ **Dockerized Environment**: Ready-to-deploy simulation.

Inspired by the advancements in our aerospace industry, this project demonstrates how we can use Code and AI to ensure safety in the skies.
